Inside, towering shelves reached the ceiling, every one crammed full of wonderful books. Rintaro Natsuki loved this space that his grandfather had created. He spent many happy hours there, reading whatever he liked. It was the perfect refuge for a boy who tended to be something of a recluse. After the death of his grandfather, Rintaro is devastated and alone. It seems he will have to close the shop. Then, a talking tabby cat called Tiger appears and asks Rintaro for help. The cat needs a book lover to join him on a mission. This odd couple will go on three magical adventures to save books from people who have imprisoned, mistreated and betrayed them. Finally, there is one last rescue that Rintaro must attempt alone . . . The Cat Who Saved Books is a heart-warming story about finding courage, caring for others – and the tremendous power of books. Sosuke Natsukawa's international bestseller, translated from Japanese by Louise Heal Kawai, is a story for those for whom books are so much more than words on paper.",

Divided into key themes--\"Snap Cat,\" \"Cats on Laps,\" \"Fierce Felines,\" \"Scratchy Sketches,\" \"Painterly Paws,\" and \"Prints and Pawings\"--this little book considers how cats have been revered in culture and have influenced artists over the centuries. Works of art--including paintings, drawings, sculptures, illustrations, and installations--are introduced by a brief introduction text adding background detail or additional information about the art, artists, and their subjects. Featured artists include: Prunella Clough, John Craxton, Sunil Gupta, Édouard Manet, Bernard Leach, David Hockney, William Blake, Andy Warhol, and Alex Katz. Sometimes traditional, sometimes contemporary, often touching and occasionally telling, placed together these beautiful images create a fascinating and enlightening journey through the visual portrayal of cats in Western art.",
